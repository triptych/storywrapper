I get 10 times more traffic from [Google] [1] than from
[Yahoo] [2] or [MSN] [3].

[1]: http://google.com/        "Google"
[2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
[3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"

Using the implicit link name shortcut, you could instead write:

I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][] than from
[Yahoo][] or [MSN][].

[google]: http://google.com/        "Google"
[yahoo]:  http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
[msn]:    http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"
